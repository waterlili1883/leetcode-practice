# LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various **LeetCode problems**, written in **Java**.  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills while maintaining clean, consistent, and well-documented code.

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- Each problem is implemented as a separate Java class.
- File naming convention:  
  `LC<problem_number>_<ProblemName>.java`  
  e.g., `LC242_ValidAnagram.java`, `LC387_FirstUniqueCharacterInAString.java`
- All files are organized under the `strings`, `arrays`, or other relevant packages.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Clean code style**: descriptive variable names, modular methods.
- **Javadoc comments**: each class includes:
  - Problem description
  - Approach explanation
  - Time and space complexity
- **Commit messages** follow the format:
feat(strings): solve LC242_ValidAnagram using HashMap (O(n), O(k))
