/**
 * LC141 - Linked List Cycle
 *
 * Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again
 * by continuously following the next pointer.
 *
 * Approach (Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm):
 *  - Use two pointers: "slow" moves one step at a time, "fast" moves two steps at a time.
 *  - If there is a cycle, the two pointers will eventually meet inside the cycle.
 *  - If fast or fast.next becomes null, the list has no cycle.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
